Lesson 1: Reflection
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

With command prompt > cd to different directory. You can compare to files with the command fc <name old doc> <name new doc>

This still is a very tiresome method in my opion.

	It's easier to look thing up. If you make a mistake you can easily go back to your old file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	I understand this is the best possible way, but I must admit that I do like autosave

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	When you are programming, in most cases, you are working with multiple files. Most users don't work with multiple interdependable files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git diff old_vers new_version > count it yourself!
	git log --stat the easy way

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	If you make a mistake... it's easy to go back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	
	I have to look into this. Now is not the time, because it's late
